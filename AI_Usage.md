## AI Usage

AI tools (GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT) were used during the development of this project exclusively as helping and guiding tools. In particular, I employed them in order to speed up routine coding tasks and support debugging. I personally designed and applied all core methodological choices, model implementations and evaluations, with AI tools used as a support to better understand underlying financial principles and best-practices for the application of coding to finance.

I carefully reviewed every piece of code suggested by the AI, modified it when necessary, and fully understood before integrating it into the project. I furthermore verified and studied all results and conclusions to ensure correctness, consistency, and reproducibility.
